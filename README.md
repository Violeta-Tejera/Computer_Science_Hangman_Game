This game is aimed for people with bare computer science knowledge so that through gamification they can learn more about some computer science concepts and definitions. Please note that these definitions are too shallow in order to just provide basic understanding of the concepts. There is much more depth and detail to each of them.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

## Running the code
After downloading the source code. Install python and call in your terminal:

python3 hangman.py

This will show the game in the command prompt and will allow it to play it.

## Tech Stack

The whole project is programmed in Python and no additional technologies or languages were used. The main reason behind this is that I want users not only to learn CS theory but also for them to be able to understand my code if it is their first approach to programming. That's why I also chose Python.
